            <aside><b>Dogs are mammals, usually to be kept as pets, or work on farms or for the police. Some dogs are
                    trained to be
                    rescue
                    dogs and join teams such as mountain rescue.[4]


                    Wolves (left) were domesticated by humans into dogs (right)
                    Dogs have been bred by humans from ancestral wolves. They were the first animals to live with
                    humans.[5]

                    There was a lot of different types among wolves in the Late Pleistocene.[1] The dingo is also a dog,
                    but
                    many dingos
                    have become wild animals again and live in the wild, away from humans (parts of Australia).[6]

                    Today, some dogs are used as pets, and others are used to help humans do their work. They are
                    popular
                    pets
                    because they
                    are usually playful, friendly, loyal, and listen to humans. Thirty million dogs in the United States
                    have
                    been
                    registered as pets.[7] Dogs eat both meat and vegetables. Often mixed together and sold in stores as
                    dog
                    food.[8] Dogs
                    often have jobs including police dogs, army dogs, assistance dogs, fire dogs, messenger dogs,
                    hunting
                    dogs,
                    herding
                    dogs, or rescue dogs. They are sometimes called "canines" from the Latin word for dog - canis.
                    Wolves
                    are
                    also canines.
                    A baby dog is called a pup or puppy. A dog is called a puppy until it is about one year old.[9]

                    Dogs are sometimes known as "human's best friend" because they are kept as pets, are usually loyal,
                    and
                    like
                    being
                    around humans. Dogs like to be petted, but only when they can first see the petter's hand before
                    being
                    petted.[10]

                    August 26 is National Dog Day worldwide.[11] While March 23 is National Puppy Day in the United
                    States.[12]</b></aside>
